In the utils files I implemented helper functions for the default handler:
    - get_segment(): returns the segment which contains the specified address,
or -1 if the address is not cointained in any segment;
    - get_page_in_segment(): returns the page in the given segment which contains
the specified address;
    - is_page_mapped(): checks if a page has already been mapped, to determine if or not
to call the default signal handler;

The signal handler checks if a the accessed addressed is contained within any of the
executable's segments. If it is, it finds the page which should contain the address and
checks if that page has already been mapped. If not, it maps the page, initializing it with 0 (this is done with the flag MAP_ANON). I then checks if the address is contained
within the segment's file memory and loads the contents of the file into it if necessary.

I used a static variable "fd" to hold the executable's file descriptor returned by the open() function call.
